' Description: Includes all the API stuff necessary for the
'              control to work.
'                               THIS IS IMPORTANT
'              Remember to register rsaenh.dll on your system's registry
'              using Regsvr32.dll.

'              From the Author:
'              'cause I consider myself in a continuous learning
'              path with no end on programming, please, if you
'              can improve this program
'              contact me at: *TONYDSPANIARD@HOTMAIL.COM*
'
'              I would be pleased to hear from your opinions,
'              suggestions, and/or recommendations. Also, if you
'              know something I don't know and wish to share it
'              with me, here you'll have your techy pal from Spain
'              that will do exactly the same towards you. If I can
'              help you in any way, just ask.
